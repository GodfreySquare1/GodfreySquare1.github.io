# The To-Do-List

The To-Do-List allows users to add items to a list, they will first need to clone or fork the project as it was created on my localhost. This was built with the following programming lanaguages:

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JavaScript

# To-Do-List Features:
1.Add a string from the textfield by using the + Button.
2.Edit a string that was entered.
3.Delete a string that was entered.
4.Mark off a string as complete.
5.Undoe mark off.

I am still currently tweaking it and testing the new features before committing any changes, I am also working on styling it to make it look better, this is the first version of the To-Do-List
