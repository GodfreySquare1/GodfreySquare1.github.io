# The To-Do-List

The To-Do-List allows users to add items to a list, they will first need to clone or fork the project as it was created on my localhost. This was built with the following programming lanaguages as part of creating my profile on **GitHub**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# To-Do-List Features:
* Add a string from the textfield by using the + Button.
* Edit a string that was entered.
* Delete a string that was entered.
* Mark off a string as complete.
* Undoe mark off.

I am still currently tweaking it and testing the new features before committing any changes, I am also working on styling it to make it look better, this is the first version of the To-Do-List.
